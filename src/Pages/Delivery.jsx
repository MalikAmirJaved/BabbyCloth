              <li className='text-base sm:text-lg'>We ship in business days. Monday - Friday, excluding national holidays.</li>
              <li className='text-base sm:text-lg'>Shipping starts from the date you received the “Your Order Has Shipped!” email.</li>
              <li className='text-base sm:text-lg'>The estimate above does not include manufacturing time - we need 1-3 business days to make sure your custom order is everything you hoped it would be.</li>

            <p className='text-base sm:text-lg mb-6'>
              We rely on a global network of shipping partners (UPS, FedEx, DHL) as well as local postal services (USPS) to get your order to your doorstep as soon as possible. For this reason, tracking is not always available. If your order is being sent by a trackable service, these details will be included on your orders page as well as on the shipping email we send you.
